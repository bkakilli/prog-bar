# Progress Bar For Multi Processing in Python
```progbar.py ```
module that I created is for monitoring the progress of the processes. Best competible with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. 





Competible ```Multiporcessing``` functions:
```
* Pool.map()
* Pool.imap()
* Pool.map_async()
* Process
```

This piece of algorithm pomps up a proggress bar on to your terminal for multiprocessing (can be used with pool.map, pool.imap, pool.map_async, and process) which contains id of your processes, estimated execution time, launch time, percentage of the work done etc.)
